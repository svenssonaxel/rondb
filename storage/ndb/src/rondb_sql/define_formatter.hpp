/*
 * The DEFINE_FORMATTER macro is used to define a custom formatter for
 * convenient usage with ostream, but without std::format which was introduced
 * in C++20. The anonymous namespace limits the formatter's visibility to the
 * current translation unit, i.e. it will behave similarly to a function
 * declared `static` and so won't be visible to the linker. The macro parameters
 * are:
 * - A name for the formatter. This is technically a class name although it's
 *   supposed to feel like a function when it's used.
 * - The type of the value, the thing to be formatted. Note that const
 *   qualifier(s) will be added automatically.
 * - A body of code printing `value` to `os`. Enclosing it in braces can provide
 *   clarity but is not required.
 * It is possible to define several formatters with the same name, as long as
 * the value type is different enough.
 *
 * Example usage:
 ***********************************************************
     #include <iostream>
     #include <cstring>
     #include "define_formatter.hpp"

     DEFINE_FORMATTER(pad2, uint, {
       if (value < 10) os << '0';
       os << value;
     })

     DEFINE_FORMATTER(pad4, uint, {
       if (value < 10) os << '0';
       if (value < 100) os << '0';
       if (value < 1000) os << '0';
       os << value;
     })

     DEFINE_FORMATTER(pad4, char*, {
       for (uint i = strlen(value); i < 4; i++)
         os << '_';
       os << value;
     })

     int main()
     {
       std::cout << "Padded 2: " << pad2(1) << std::endl
                 << "Padded 4: " << pad4(23) << std::endl
                 << "Padded 4: " << pad4("abc") << std::endl;
     }

// DEFINE_FORMATTER__addconst_t<some_type> is a helper type. It adds the const
// qualifier to some_type at all levels of indirection. For example:
//   DEFINE_FORMATTER__addconst_t<int> -> const int
//   DEFINE_FORMATTER__addconst_t<int**> -> const int *const *const
// This is helpful, since operator<< needs a const argument.
template<typename T>struct DEFINE_FORMATTER__addconst
{ using type = const T; };
template<typename T>struct DEFINE_FORMATTER__addconst<T*>
{ using type = typename DEFINE_FORMATTER__addconst<T>::type* const; };
template<typename T>using  DEFINE_FORMATTER__addconst_t =
  typename DEFINE_FORMATTER__addconst<T>::type;

// We want to be able to define formatters with the same name for different
// value types, and formatters with different names for the same value type, all
// with distinct logic. Function overloading works well for this, however there
// is one issue: A formatter is essentially an overload for operator<<, which
// will be dispatched/selected based on the type returned by the formatter.
// Therefore, the return type of each formatter, i.e. combination of formatter
// name and value type, has to be distinct. We define a wrapper class for this purpose. We need a unique name for each such
// class. DEFINE_FORMATTER__GENSYM is a helper macro that generates a unique
// identifier given a prefix. It needs two levels of indirection in order to
// correctly expand before concatenating. For example:
//   DEFINE_FORMATTER__GENSYM(hello)
//   => DEFINE_FORMATTER__CONCAT1(hello, __COUNTER__)
//   => DEFINE_FORMATTER__CONCAT2(hello, 7)
//   => hello7
#define DEFINE_FORMATTER__GENSYM(X) DEFINE_FORMATTER__CONCAT1(X, __COUNTER__)
#define DEFINE_FORMATTER__CONCAT1(x, y) DEFINE_FORMATTER__CONCAT2(x, y)
#define DEFINE_FORMATTER__CONCAT2(x, y) x##y

// DEFINE_FORMATTER is the user interface as described above. The helper macro
// call allows us to
// - Add the const qualifiers to the value type in just one place.
// - Generate a unique name for a wrapper class that can then be used in several
//   places. More than one call to DEFINE_FORMATTER__GENSYM would result in
//   different names.
// The use of variadic macro arguments is required in order to correctly process
// a code body containing comma tokens.

// - An anonymous namespace, which limits the visibility of all the definitions
//   to the current translation unit, i.e. it will behave similarly to a
//   function declared `static` and so won't be visible to the linker.
// - A wrapper class with a unique name. This is necessary since operator<<
//   can only dispatch on a type, while we want to dispatch on a combination of
//   identifier and type, like overloaded functions (see comment above).
// - The overloaded operator<< containing the formatting logic.
// - The formatter function itself, whose sole purpose is to achieve the
//   dispatch we want; identifier and type. It makes the formatter work like an
//   overloaded function because that's exactly what it is.
