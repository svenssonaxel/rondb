 * 1) ArenaAllocator has no need to keep track of allocation sizes.
 * 2) ArenaAllocator can reallocate memory that was allocated by other means
 *    than itself, on the condition that no free() is necessary.
 * 3) ArenaAllocator can potentially reallocate in-place a block of memory that
 *    is the result of concatenating several allocations.
