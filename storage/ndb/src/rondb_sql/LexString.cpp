 * Byte by byte comparison. This can still return false for two equivalent UTF-8
 * strings if:
 * 1) The strings are not validated and e.g. one contains an overlong encoded
 *    character.
 * 2) The strings are not normalized to the same degree as your definition for
 *    "equivalent". For example, the grapheme[†] "ä", i.e. the shape that looks
 *    like a small character "a" with two dots above it, can be produced by the
 *    code point U+00e4 (LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS), or by a sequence
 *    of the two code points U+0061 (LATIN SMALL LETTER A) and U+0308 (COMBINING
 *    DIAERESIS). Thus, two strings can look the same when printed, yet compare
 *    as unequal. Unicode normalization[‡] is the process of transforming
 *    strings to a canonical form, so that strings that look the same when
 *    printed (are more likely to) compare as equal.
